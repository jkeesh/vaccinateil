I"¢<p>We are an ad hoc collection of volunteers, trying to move as quickly as possible to get Californians up-to-date COVID-19 vaccine information. We have a core team of approximately ten people and approximately 100 volunteers calling to find out about vaccine availability.</p>

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
</h2>

<p><strong>How can I help?</strong></p>

<p>Get the word out about the vaccine in your community. Help your eligible loved ones get the vaccine. Continue wearing your mask and observe social distancing guidelines.</p>

<p>We do not need more volunteers right now; we‚Äôre running this out of our networks to move as quickly as possible. This may change in a few days; check back for updates or <a href="https://twitter.com/ca_covid">follow us on Twitter</a>.</p>

<p>We also don‚Äôt need money. Many charitable projects <em>do</em>; they would appreciate your generous support.</p>

<p><strong>I am a reporter. Can I get in touch?</strong></p>

<p>Please email <a href="mailto:media@vaccinateca.com">media@vaccinateca.com</a>; we‚Äôll be in touch quickly.</p>

<p><strong>I work at a medical provider! How do I ask you to update our information or make a request of you?</strong></p>

<p>We appreciate the work you are doing, and are here to support it!</p>

<p>Please text <a href="tel:+14153014597">(415) 301-4597</a> with your message, institutional affiliation, and an internal extension or contact name so we can call back to verify. We cannot receive photos at this number; text only, please.</p>

<p>One of the organizers will read your message and take action as soon as reasonably possible.</p>

<p><strong>I work in a community-facing organization or for the government. Can we discuss this?</strong></p>

<p>We want to support the urgent work you are doing in getting Californians vaccinated as quickly as possible. Please email us at <a href="mailto:partners@vaccinateca.com">partners@vaccinateca.com</a> to discuss.</p>

<p><strong>Does this effort increase or decrease toil in the healthcare system?</strong></p>

<p>Most hospitals will get thousands of phone calls per day. They are currently being slammed by many more people than usual asking them the same question: ‚ÄúDo you have the vaccine?‚Äù</p>

<p>By asking that question and publishing the answer, we can save their phone bandwidth for the day-to-day operations of the hospital. We also save people seeking the vaccine from having to call dozens of locations to find one that has availability.</p>

<p><strong>Is the information on this website accurate?</strong></p>

<p>We publish only what the vaccine site told us when we called. The situation is complex, supplies may vary throughout the day, and not everyone at the site might have up-to-the-minute information as to what their policies actually are.</p>

<p>We‚Äôre doing our best, but can‚Äôt make any guarantees.</p>
